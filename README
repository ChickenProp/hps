Hyper Primate Sphere

Written in Clojure. Also requires my libraries gvec and cloggle, both available
on my github page, as well as clojure-contrib.

Get the hypersphere through the goal by rotating the spherical stage through the
forth dimension. This dimension is represented by color: red points have a
positive w-coordinate, blue points have a negative one. If the hypersphere falls
off the stage without going through the goal, you lose.

Controls: f,g rotate the stage in the x-w directions. e,d rotate it in y-w, and
w,s rotate it in z-w. esc quits. Space restarts. Drag the mouse to change
viewing position. (Known bug: this is a poorly implemented feature. If you move
the camera too far from its original position, further movements will start to
become hard to predict.)

Passing the -d command line option will cause the controls to be made
dvorak-suitable through the obvious substitutions.
